## Installation

### For `Windows`

- Download the prebuilt `zip file` [from here](https://github.com/prodicus/spaceShooter/releases/download/v0.0.1/spaceShooter-0.0.1-windows.zip) and extract the file to your preferred destination by using [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/download.html) or [winzip](http://www.winzip.com/prod_down.html) or any other similar program of your choice.
- Run the executable named `spaceShooter` inside the extracted file.

### For `MAC OS X` and `Linux/Debian` based systems

#### Option 1: Download the zipped executable file

- Download the [latest zip file](https://github.com/prodicus/spaceShooter/releases/download/v0.0.1/SpaceShooter-0.0.1.Linux.zip)
- Unzip the file

If your download was saved on the `~/Downloads` folder

Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd> to open the shell if you are on `GNU/Linux` based systems and type

```bash
$ unzip SpaceShooter-0.0.1.Linux.zip -d ~/Desktop
$ cd ~/Desktop
~/Desktop $ chmod +x spaceShooter
~/Desktop $ ./spaceShooter
```

This will unzip the file on your `Desktop`, you can replace it with the directory of your choice

**NOTE** : If it gives you an error, you probably don't have `unzip` installed in your system.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install unzip
```
That should fix the error.

- Run the executable named `spaceShooter`

A Similar process would be followed for `OS X`

#### Option 2: Build from source

You need to have `pygame` installed for this option. 

##### Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install python-pygame
```

##### OS X

```bash
$ pip3 install hg+http://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame
```

Install Pygame specific dependencies

```bash
$ brew install sdl sdl_image sdl_ttf portmidi libogg libvorbis
$ brew install sdl_mixer --with-libvorbis
```

##### Clone the repo

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/prodicus/spaceShooter.git
$ cd spaceShooter/ 
$ python spaceShooter.py
```

Enjoy the game!
